<h1>Standardized tests are stupid, says expert</h1>

<p>Y'know those stupid tests you had to take all throughout school? Well, they are still heavily in use today. That's right: the same freaking tests that have been used since -1,000,000 BCE. Worse, even after an infinite amount of years, they're still as cruddy as before. In one survey, 99% of high school students said that they despise tests. One student shared with us a story from his youth. "One time, my favorite youtuber was livestreaming all day, but I also had to take the STAAR test on the same day. When I ran out the door the principal was like, 'nah fam,' and then I was, like, so triggered and I punched him in the face and ran out. And police cars started chasing me, so I took my pencil and threw it at the cars and it made them explode, and I was like 'yee' but then Godzilla showed up and started shooting me with lasers and I was like 'bruh' and then the highway exploded and I, like, ran to McDonalds because the running was making me tired so I bought a Coke and as soon as he gave it to me the store exploded and I was so triggered that I didn't get a refund but I was like, 'whatevs' but then the universe exploded and I was like 'nooooo' but now I'm ok."</p>
