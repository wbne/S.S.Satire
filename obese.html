  <h1>The Growing Obesity Problem</h1>
	<p>In 1990, obesity emerged as a serious issue as the BMI of the average person skyrocketed. Today, obesity is still a huge problem. Over 2 out of every 3 American adults are overweight or obese. Additionally, America spends about $150 billion dollars on obesity-related issues each year. Obesity has worsened over the years thanks to the growing unhealthiness of our foods and our new sedentary lifestyles. Studies show if this process of "fattening" America continues, by 2030, 51% of the American population will be classified as "obese". As portions increase and Americans spend more time sitting at desk jobs, the obesity problem worsens. </p>
	<ul>
	<p> So how can we stop this? Here are some ways to prevent obesity in your household. </p>
		<li>Eat five to six servings of vegetables each day.</li>
		<li>Exercise for at least 30 minutes each day.</li>
		<li>Eat whole grain foods and avoid highly processed foods with refined sugars and grains.</li>
	</ul>
