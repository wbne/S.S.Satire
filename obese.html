  <h1>The Growing Obesity Problem</h1>
	  <img src="poster.png" alt="Poster: Stop Lovin' Obesity" />
	<p>In 1990, obesity emerged as a serious issue as the BMI of the average person skyrocketed. Today, obesity is still a huge problem. Over 2 in 3 American adults are overweight or obese. Additionally, America spends about $150 billion dollars on obesity-related issues each year. Obesity has worsened over the years thanks to the growing unhealthiness of our foods and our new sedentary lifestyles. Studies show if this process of "fattening" America continues, by 2030, 51% of the American population will be classified as "obese". As portions increase and Americans spend more time sitting at desk jobs, the obesity problem worsens. </p>
	  <p>Obesity is a disease. More and more people are becoming overweight. This trend can only be stopped by taking action. Here are some ways to prevent obesity in your household.</p>
