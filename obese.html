  <h1>The Growing Obesity Problem</h1>
	<p>In 1990, obesity emerged as a serious issue as the BMI of the average person skyrocketed. Today, obesity is still a huge problem. Over 2 out of every 3 American adults are overweight or obese. Additionally, America spends about $150 billion dollars on obesity-related issues each year. Obesity has worsened over the years thanks to the growing unhealthiness of our foods and our new sedentary lifestyles. As portions increase and Americans spend more time sitting at desk jobs, the obesity problem worsens. </p>
