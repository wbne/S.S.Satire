<h1>Pranoy Admits to Being a Narcissist</h1>
<p>Written by David Li and Ben Wang at 10:30 Tuesday, April 11th</p>
<p>This past Friday, after a long time of prodding and poking, Pranoy Dutta has finally admitted to being a narcissist! It started off as a normal lunch, with Pranoy spouting out phrases about his perfectly chiseled face and how he was so smart. After a while, however, he finally announced, "I'm so handsome, it's no surprise that I'm narcissistic. If you had my face you would too!" Gaping, the people near him quickly took out their phones and asked him to repeat himself. Within seconds, the aspiring Indian programmer was across the internet, saying how he was a narcissist. Many people are not surprised, however, and only shrugged saying that it was about time he finally admitted it.  </p>
