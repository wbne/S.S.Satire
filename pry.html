<h1>Pranoy Admits to Being a Narcissist</h1>
<p>Written by David Wang and Ben Li at 10:30 Tuesday, April 11th</p>
<p>This past Friday, after a long time of prodding and poking, Pranoy Dutta has finally admitted to being a narcissist! It started off as a normal lunch, with Pranoy spouting out phrases about his perfectly chiseled face and how he was so smart. After a while, however, he finally announced, "I'm so handsome, it's no surprise that I'm narcissistic. If you had my face you would too!" Gaping, the people near him quickly took out their phones and asked him to repeat himself. Within seconds, the aspiring Indian programmer was across the internet, saying how he was a narcissist. Many people are not surprised, however, and only shrugged saying that it was about time he finally admitted it.  </p>
      <br>
    <p>Interviewing with some local students here at Fowler Middle School, we talked to Ben Wang, a person who was there at the infamous scene.</p>
      <p>"I was in shock" Ben stated, "I've always joked about it with Pranoy, as he does frequently talk about his nose. But when he actually admitted to it, the first thing I did was call 911, as somebody might get a heart attack from this shocking news."</p>
      <p>While Ben may not be the sharpest spoon in the fork drawer, it is clear that the locals have been bamboozled by Pranoy's proclamation. Another student we interviewed contravened stating "It was obvious from the start." The student started, "You could tell from his stature that he was clearly was a narcissist. The first time I saw him, I was like, 'Dang, this guy is totally a narcissist', then Ben stole my wallet."</p>
      <p>It is not clear how exactly the locals think, but one thing is for sure, Pranoy had admitted to being a narcissist on April 10th, 12:58 pm.</p>
