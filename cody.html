<p>Interesting Fact: Silver Chloride will not easily dissolve into a polar solution due to the electric distribution of the molecule, allowing for easy extraction of the precious silver. As for gold, it requires a combination of Hydrochloric Acid and Nitric Acid to be mixed in order to create Aqua Regia. When it dissolves gold, it becomes Chloroauric Acid.</p>

<p>Youtuber Cody, owner of Cody's Lab with over a million subscribers, has created a ring from his own mine.</p>
<p>Living in Utah, an area with abundant lands along with mines, this is a perfect place for somebody like Cody, who creates many things from scratch.</p>
<p>Instead of purchasing a completely new ring, Cody decided that creating one would be much more valuable.</p>
